# Dotfiles

This is my folder for my Arch dotfiles

## Installation

Run the setup.sh to install all of the configs and executables needed. You can download that from a fresh install Arch with the following command: ``curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wrench56/dotfiles/main/scripts/setup.sh``. After that make `setup.sh` executable with `chmod +x setup.sh`. Then simply run it with `./setup.sh`.

## Folders

A quick explanation of what the different folders are for.

##### nvim

In the ``nvim`` folder, you can find my neovim configs for the famous terminal-based editor.

##### scripts

I tend to automate everything, so in the ``scripts`` folder you will find setup scripts (after a fresh Arch install) and more.

## Plans

I always wanted to try Debian (the debootstraped version). Later on, I might port over the setup script to be usable on Debian as well.
